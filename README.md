# Group5_FinalProject

  Our website will help people who are applying for internships or jobs track their applications and progress. Users will be able to make a list of companies they have applied to along with notes that they have made about the companies. Users can also make a list of companies that they would like to apply to but have not yet done so. A tab containing a calendar of the users upcoming interviews and application deadlines will also be included. We may include some more tools, but the overall purpose of the website is to organize the application process.
